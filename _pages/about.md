<h1 title='Hello in Arabic'> السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ </h1>
<p> Hello! I'm a first year PhD scholar of Artificial Intelligence at the Korea Advance Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I am working in <a href="https://xfact.net/"> xfact</a> lab where I am being guided by two esteemed professors -  <a href='https://sites.google.com/a/kaist.edu/song-chong'>Song Chong</a> and <a href='https://jamesthorne.com/'> James Thorne</a>. My area of research is Natural Language Processing (NLP), and I specifically focus on the following topics:
<ul>
  <li> Adaptive Language models to incorporate new information into their existing knowledge</li>
  <li> Using Reinforcement Learning to generate better responce in Large Language Models </li>
  <li> Knowledge extraction and fact verification in Large Language Models</li>
  <li> Logic and Reasoning in Large Language Models</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> In addition, I have previous experience working in Reinforcement Learning, specifically in the area of Vision-Language Navigation. I look forward to contributing to the field of AI through my ongoing research and future endeavors. </p>

<p> Thank you for visiting my website! <br> <br>
Hit me up if you have any questions about my research or if you want to get lost in the cosmos talking about the meaning of life and how and why everything came to existance. I'm kind of an optimistic nihilist. </p>
