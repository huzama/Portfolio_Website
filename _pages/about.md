 <h3 title='Hello in Arabic' style='font-family: adobe arabic'> السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ </h3>
<strong style='color: #696969; display: inline'> Hmm... Anyways </strong>
<p> I'm a PhD scholar of Artificial Intelligence at the Korea Advance Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I am working in <a href="https://xfact.net/"> xfact</a> lab where I am being guided by two esteemed professors -  <a href='https://sites.google.com/a/kaist.edu/song-chong'>Song Chong</a> and <a href='https://jamesthorne.com/'> James Thorne</a>. My research interest is to help AI take over the world, specifically
<ul>
  <li> Creativity, Imagination, and Reasoning abilities of LLMs </li>
  <li> Continual Learning and Adaptivity of  LLMs</li>
  <li> Knowledge and Congitiion in LLMs </li>
</ul>
In addition, I have previous experience working in Reinforcement Learning in the area of Vision-Language Navigation </p>
<br><br>
<h2> misc. </h2>
<p> When I'm not working, you might find me doing calisthenics to stay fit, exploring nature through hiking, or indulging in the soulful sounds of the violin. I'm also passionate about exploring the mysteries of the universe with topics like Quantum Mechanics, Rocket Science, and almost any other physical phenomena
<br><br>
Thank you for visiting my website! <br>
Hit me up if you have any questions about my research or if you want to get lost in the cosmos talking about the meaning of life and how and why everything came to existance. I'm kind of an optimistic nihilist. </p>
